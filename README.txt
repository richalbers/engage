
For simply viewing the pages (to work on style sheet), you can open the page locally (doubleclick on engage.html) and then add the following to the end of the URL

	?class=CLIENT-TEST&room=S181&userName=client.test
	

The URL will then look something like this:
	file:///C:/Users/Rich/Desktop/seatingChart-master%20(2)/seatingChart-master/engage.html?class=CLIENT-TEST&room=S181&userName=client.test

It will intitially show what that page looks like for students (just two tabs).

clicking on the instructors seat will request a password, just hit enter and you'll then see what the page looks like from the instructors point of view. (all tabs)


Note: running it like this (with class=CLIENT-TEST and userName=client.test) no data is retrieved from the server; server calls are replaced with some test data.
